      "I recently upgraded to Sony Bravia LED, Denon AV receiver and Sony BluRay.  Before now, I never had the need for any HDMI cables.  I was very skeptical about buying a less known and lower priced cable.  Most of the time...the old \"you get what you pay for\" holds true.  This is the exception!  I did a lot of reading on the subject first.  Plenty of opinions.  Some say spend the big bucks on the Monster HDMI.  Others say don't.  Consumer reports suggested that spending the extra money on higher priced HDMI cables was not necessary.  As long as the cable was well constructed and supported the type of signal you were after, it would either carry it or it wouldn't.  Simplistic way of looking at it, but seemed to make sense.I then made a trip to Best Buy.  A nice fellow that claimed to be an expert on these types of things tried his best to get me to spend $129 on a ten foot Monster HDMI cable.  Because he would not stop talking about his expertise on the subject, he let it slip that the brand of cable he personally uses was not available at Best Buy.I then made a visit to a high end audio video store.  Most seemed to agree, though only with a whisper and a nudge, that the high dollar HDMI cables were not worth it.So...I found the Mediabridge brand on Amazon.  Still highly skeptical, I read the many very positive reviews.  I needed four.  I ordered one six foot cable.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality construction and shielding when I first opened the box.  Connected the ATT Uverse HD/DVR to the TV for a trial run.  It worked perfectly.  After a week, I ordered three more.  For the price I paid for four of the six foot Mediabridge HDMI cables, I could not have bought one of the Monster HDMI cables that the chubby fella at Best Buy was trying to sell me.  Yes, the packaging on the Monster was much more flashy, and the shielding was a bit thicker.Now....HD/DVR, BluRay and DVD player (I still wanted the DVD because it is a 5 disc and I occasionally like to load it up with music) are all connected to my receiver with these HDMI cables.  One cable then from receiver to the television.  They all perform without a single flaw.  The DTS HD Master Audio and Dolby TrueHD Audio along with 1080p runs perfectly through these HDMI cables.If you are on the fence, get this HDMI cable.  I am not easily impressed.  I am impressed by the quality and price of the Mediabridge six foot HDMI cable!!!\n",

      "This is a great HDMI cable.  This is but one of Mediabridge Cables I have put to use in my home, plus I have ordered some of these cables for other persons. Works as good, if not better, than my very first HDMI cable purchased from a big box store back when I bought my first HD TV.  For the total purchase price of that first HDMI cable I could have paid for nearly every Mediabridge Cable I am using or have purchased.  Live and learn.The 'price' for this cable is of course the biggest selling point.  The 'quality' of the Mediabrige HDMI cable is the best 'multiple' selling point.'Can't go wrong here if you are in need of an HDMI cable.  Purchase one without worry and keep some extra dollars in your pocket.\n",

      "I bought these Mediabridge Ultra Series Cables because I had previously purchased Mediabridge HDMI cables and Cat 5 cables and was completely satisfied with them. I had in the past purchased Monster Cable HDMI cables and although they work quite well they are very expensive. You can buy at least 4 Mediabridge cables for the price of 1 Monster Cable. So last year when I was changing my home theater system around and I needed new HDMI cables and I really didn't want to spend a couple of hundred dollars on them so I took a chance on Mediabridge. They appear to be very well made and most importantly they work very well, they work as well as any Monster cable I have used. I would recommend to anyone that you give them a try.\n",

      "Comparative Results: Technically Average, Overall Value Slightly below fair**Explanation**Explanation of technique used for Review (actual results are below with accompanying title).My first inclination when I received this cable, was to attempt to do a side-by-side comparison of various HDMI cables to determine what benefit, if any the various cables provide.  To make such a test fair however, I had to find identical televisions, input devices, (cable box, blu-ray, standard dvd, etc), and a place to put them; as you may imagine this proved to be way more effort than it would be worth.After contemplating the issue I came to the conclusion that such a test would be pretty worthless anyways.  Since I (like most people) never watch identical televisions side by side the real question lies in whether one HDMI cable improves the picture enough that it is discernable without viewing the pictures simultaneously.  After all, if a viewer cannot discern a difference between the two without looking at both together, then there is no justifiable reason to buy one over the other.With this in mind I used the following equipment to test the cables:Television: Sony Grand WEGA KDS-55A2000 55-Inch SXRD 1080p Rear Projection HDTVCables:1.HDMI Cable 6ft 6 ft 1.3 1080P FOR PS3 TO DVD LCD HDTV2.Cables To Go 98035 Premium HDMI v1.3 Digital Audio/Video Cable (8 Feet, Black/Grey)3.Mediabridge - 6ft Ultra-High Speed HDMI Cable - 120 Hz - Version 1.3 Category 2 - 1080p - PS3 - Blu-Ray4.Monster M Series M1000 HDTV HDMI Cable (8 ft. / 2.43 m.)5.Sony 5mm High speed HDMI cable ver. 1.3 (White)Inputs:1.PlayStation 3 80GB2. Optimum HD Cable Box/DVR (not sure of the model number)**The Test**To conduct the test I had my wife label each of the cables with a number, the cables were mixed then piled together behind the television.  With my wife assigned as the operator.  I and two friends sat on the other side of the television.  We watched pieces of Planet Earth on Blu-Ray, as well as Transformers on Blu-Ray and Standard Def.  In addition, we watched the same song from American Idol in both HD and SD, and portions of an NBA playoff game.Each of us had a card numbered 1-5 with space for comments on image quality, sound, etc.,  for each cable.  The test was, as aforementioned, blind.  This was to ensure that one of my friends (one of whom provided the $200 monster cable) and I, owner of the .01 + shipping no name cable (and most of the other ones) would not be biased by knowing it was our cable.  If you shell out $200 for something you really want it to outperform, which creates bias.And now:**The Results**All three of us agreed that there were no conclusive differences in the test.  After a lot of switching between various inputs the conclusion was that while we occasionally perceived slight differences it was never clear and would be impossible to tell if the two pictures were not side by side.Thus I must conclude that these 5 HDMI cables are, for all practical purposes, identical.  Which means that they all had average performance and the main purchase determiners are price, aesthetic quality and build quality.So to sum up, taking into account my opinion of the different cables, the HDMI Cable 6ft 6 ft 1.3 1080P FOR PS3 TO DVD LCD HDTV is the cheapest and feels it, it will probably need to be replaced soonest as well but at .01 cent plus shipping you can afford to.  The Cables To Go 98035 Premium HDMI v1.3 Digital Audio/Video Cable (8 Feet, Black/Grey) and Mediabridge - 6ft Ultra-High Speed HDMI Cable - 120 Hz - Version 1.3 Category 2 - 1080p - PS3 - Blu-Ray were pretty similar but I like the design and build quality of the Cable-to-Go a little more, it feels more solid, I feel like this one would last a while longer than the first cable but I didn't do any endurance tests.  My least favorite of the bunch in terms of feel/price was the Sony 5mm High speed HDMI cable ver. 1.3 (White) which I felt, was very thin and cheap feeling considering its price tag, I wouldn't bet that it would outlast either the Cable-to-Go cable or the Mediabridge.  The Monster M Series M1000 HDTV HDMI Cable (8 ft. / 2.43 m.) is well made and aesthetically pleasing and looks as if it will last you until something replaces HDMI, I cannot however recommend it because the price tag is simply preposterous, as it provides no visual or auditory improvement.\n",

      "I've bought dozens of HDMI cables since I dove into HD a number of years ago. Recently I bought a Full-HD 3D setup and was told I had to have a special cable for it. The dealer sold me a 3' cable for $90! (And, that was one of the CHEAPER ones they had!) Now, it is true you need a \"High Speed\" rated cable for 3D (especially \"FULL-HD 3D\" @1080p), but you DON'T need to spend a lot of money on one. I felt really stupid, especially since I started having odd communications issues between my BD player and TV, all of which pointed to the $90 cable. After realizing I was a fool- I thought I would try these Mediabridge cables. I actually bought 3 of the 15' ones so I could relocate all of my equipment a bit further from the HDTV.I tested all three Mediabridge cables at Full-HD 3D (1080P). No communications errors, no artifacts or other glitches- just a consistently beautiful picture! The cables came in small cardboard boxes with minimal packaging (nice for the environment), along with a nice FAQ and warranty card. They appear to be very well constructed, and are much thicker, and more solid feeling, than the expensive (and glitch-y) cable my dealer sold me. I definitely plan to make Mediabridge my preferred HDMI cable manufacturer, and will recommend them to everyone I know.Update: 2013:Since my initial review, I have bought over a dozen of these Mediabridge cables for personal and professional use. I've used the 6', 10', 15' and 25' lengths, and have NEVER had a quality issue with them. I still consider them to be the best value in HDMI cables, with quality on-par with cables costing 10x as much, and recommend them to everyone.\n",

      "I'm a PC nerd and now entered the amazing world of Home Theater Systems. I ALWAYS purchase mid to high end hardware, and refuse to use any low end cabling on any of my systems or gadgets! My PC's and hardware are an investment that I demand quality performance from. I have used RCA, Monster, Radio Shack, and Cables-To-Go in the past. When I became an Amazon shopper (Prime Member), I found the Mediabridge cable line. I first purchased only a couple of Mediabridge cables to test as a possible replacement of my existing cables. When I received the Mediabridge cables (RCA's & HDMI), I was initially impressed by their packaging/boxing. To save money & pass the savings on to you, they poly-bag and seal their cables, and then place in a Mediabridge labeled corrugated box to the size of the cable. It did not bother me that their cables were not in a retail type blister pack to make them appear like \"quality\" out of the box etc.My first test with their cable(s) was quite impressive! Mediabridge sells ULTRA PREMIUM cables at an affordable price!! My tests went so well, that I have changed ALL OF MY CABLES TO MEDIABRIDGE (if they offer my cable in their line on Amazon)!!! Their HDMI cables are heavy weight with gold plated plugs, and they carry an audio and video signal better than any other cable I have ever used. Their Toslink Optical cables are heavy yet flexible and also carry any audio signal like no other cable I've experienced. Don't hesitate to spend a few extra dollars on their RCA cables! Their RCA line is also a quality/premium product.In closing I must say again that Mediabridge cables are PREMIUM CABLES at a reasonable price. I just invested LOTS OF $$$ in to a Home Theater System for my bedroom (EVERYTHING PURCHASED THROUGH AMAZON), and I'm not going to skimp on the cables that I need. Mediabridge is the way to go! I have already purchased NUMEROUS Mediabridge cables for my systems, and I'm not done yet-I WILL ALWAYS SEARCH THE MEDIABRIDGE LINE BEFORE I BUY A DIFFERENT BRAND CABLE. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Mediabridge as your cabling source!Happy Cabling!\n",

      "This HDMI cable has cause 0 problems for me so far, and seems to be of quality build. Please read other reviews, cable beginners: DO NOT SPEND AN ARM AND A LEG ON HDMI CABLES. Best Buy and other retailers will try their darndest to upsell expensive and unnecessary HDMI cables that run between 20 and 40 dollars per foot; don't do it. An HDMI cable is an HDMI cable, and as long as the manufacturer is reputable, you will have a good HDMI cable without frills, like this one. Overall, a frugal and effective purchase for anyone wishing to connect an HDMI source to their TV or HT system.\n",

      "I have purchased a number of Mediabridge HDMI cables of different configurations and lengths and used them in the most demanding configurations, 1080P w/surround, etc.  Each has performed flawlessly.  As an electrical engineer I can tell you that there is WAAAYYY too much hype about HDMI cables having to be really high end and expensive.  The simple fact is that if they are built well and their performance is perfect, there is nothing more that will benefit you.  As an example, Monster Cable makes HDMI cables costing as much as $100 and they do NOTHING more or better than these cables, so why pay 10 times as much?  You are paying for marketing and name only, not performance.  Even at the price of around $10 a cable, you can afford to have one or two out of a dozen be sub-par, though I have not had one that didn't perform perfectly out of about 10 - 12 HDMI Mediabridge cables I have purchased.\n",

      "I'm currently using 6 HDMI cables, 4 of which are Mediabridge Cat 2 certfied and of 2 different lengths, 3-6ft and 1-10ft. One is being used to connect my pc to it's monitor, while the others are being used in my Home Theater system. MY remaining cables in use are of a different mfr and cost more, however the Mediabridges work everybit as well, are of similiar quality and made of similiar material, I would not hesitate to purchase more if the need should arise.As is the case for most all cables other than RCA or BNC types, if you move around your equipment or disturb the cable in some manner that may even slightly tug at the cable it may cause the cable to pull out or partially dislodge, so before you get to thinking you may have a faulty cable, double check all your connections to insure they are firmly plugged inIn summary, these are great cables for the money spent. You could spend a hundred or more for a HDMI cable and all you may get for it is something prettier or perhaps with better shielding, but these cables are adequately shielded for most installations. These Mediabridges are a high quality good investment, you could pay alot more for a cable and not see or hear any difference.\n",

Here are the results...COMPARISONS BETWEEN INFIGEAR AND MEDIABRIDGE AND FREEPORT OPPO HDMI CABLESI tested the InfiGear HDMI Cable against the Mediabridge, and the Freeport cable that came with my OPPO Blu-Ray Player.RESULTSThe Freeport cable that came with the OPPO Blu-Ray Player is a tad thicker than the Mediabridge and the InfiGear cables. And only the Freeport has those Ferrite Bead cylinders near the ends that reduce EM and RF interference.It was no surprise then that the OPPO Freeport cable was a bit better than the InfiGear, but only by about 1%. The picture through the OPPO cable had 1% more detail and 1% more color.The picture through the InfiGear was identical to the picture through the Mediabridge however.HOW I TESTEDBoth my receiver and my OPPO Blu-Ray player have two HDMI outputs, and my LG HDTV has two HDMI inputs, so I was able to simply use the remote to switch back and forth from one Input to the other.THE DISCS I USED FOR TESTINGI decided to use a DVD that has a bad picture when played on my old but good Sony Carousel DVD Player, and a Blu-Ray with a great picture on my new OPPO Blu-Ray player.For the bad picture, I paused a scene from season 3 of Lost In Space where Will and his mom are standing in the doorway of the Jupiter 2 talking. The scene had humans for skin tones (the most difficult color to get right). The obvious angles of the doorway (another area of difficulty). And other things and details I am familiar with. I expected the better cable to help a little, but there was no difference in picture quality on this DVD through any of the three cables.For the good picture I paused a scene from Charlie St. Cloud where he's talking with his brother at the beginning of the movie, and Charlie is wearing a medal on a ribbon with obvious angles. So again, human faces and hair, and angles, and other things and details that test a picture well.MY EQUIPMENT55&#34; LG 55L W5600 HDTVOPPO BDP-93 3D Blu-Ray PlayerSony DVD Carousel DVP-NC80V\n",

      "I recently upgraded to Sony Bravia LED, Denon AV receiver and Sony BluRay.  Before now, I never had the need for any HDMI cables.  I was very skeptical about buying a less known and lower priced cable.  Most of the time...the old \"you get what you pay for\" holds true.  This is the exception!  I did a lot of reading on the subject first.  Plenty of opinions.  Some say spend the big bucks on the Monster HDMI.  Others say don't.  Consumer reports suggested that spending the extra money on higher priced HDMI cables was not necessary.  As long as the cable was well constructed and supported the type of signal you were after, it would either carry it or it wouldn't.  Simplistic way of looking at it, but seemed to make sense.I then made a trip to Best Buy.  A nice fellow that claimed to be an expert on these types of things tried his best to get me to spend $129 on a ten foot Monster HDMI cable.  Because he would not stop talking about his expertise on the subject, he let it slip that the brand of cable he personally uses was not available at Best Buy.I then made a visit to a high end audio video store.  Most seemed to agree, though only with a whisper and a nudge, that the high dollar HDMI cables were not worth it.So...I found the Mediabridge brand on Amazon.  Still highly skeptical, I read the many very positive reviews.  I needed four.  I ordered one six foot cable.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality construction and shielding when I first opened the box.  Connected the ATT Uverse HD/DVR to the TV for a trial run.  It worked perfectly.  After a week, I ordered three more.  For the price I paid for four of the six foot Mediabridge HDMI cables, I could not have bought one of the Monster HDMI cables that the chubby fella at Best Buy was trying to sell me.  Yes, the packaging on the Monster was much more flashy, and the shielding was a bit thicker.Now....HD/DVR, BluRay and DVD player (I still wanted the DVD because it is a 5 disc and I occasionally like to load it up with music) are all connected to my receiver with these HDMI cables.  One cable then from receiver to the television.  They all perform without a single flaw.  The DTS HD Master Audio and Dolby TrueHD Audio along with 1080p runs perfectly through these HDMI cables.If you are on the fence, get this HDMI cable.  I am not easily impressed.  I am impressed by the quality and price of the Mediabridge six foot HDMI cable!!!\n",

      "I bought these Mediabridge Ultra Series Cables because I had previously purchased Mediabridge HDMI cables and Cat 5 cables and was completely satisfied with them. I had in the past purchased Monster Cable HDMI cables and although they work quite well they are very expensive. You can buy at least 4 Mediabridge cables for the price of 1 Monster Cable. So last year when I was changing my home theater system around and I needed new HDMI cables and I really didn't want to spend a couple of hundred dollars on them so I took a chance on Mediabridge. They appear to be very well made and most importantly they work very well, they work as well as any Monster cable I have used. I would recommend to anyone that you give them a try.\n",

      "Comparative Results: Technically Average, Overall Value Slightly below fair**Explanation**Explanation of technique used for Review (actual results are below with accompanying title).My first inclination when I received this cable, was to attempt to do a side-by-side comparison of various HDMI cables to determine what benefit, if any the various cables provide.  To make such a test fair however, I had to find identical televisions, input devices, (cable box, blu-ray, standard dvd, etc), and a place to put them; as you may imagine this proved to be way more effort than it would be worth.After contemplating the issue I came to the conclusion that such a test would be pretty worthless anyways.  Since I (like most people) never watch identical televisions side by side the real question lies in whether one HDMI cable improves the picture enough that it is discernable without viewing the pictures simultaneously.  After all, if a viewer cannot discern a difference between the two without looking at both together, then there is no justifiable reason to buy one over the other.With this in mind I used the following equipment to test the cables:Television: Sony Grand WEGA KDS-55A2000 55-Inch SXRD 1080p Rear Projection HDTVCables:1.HDMI Cable 6ft 6 ft 1.3 1080P FOR PS3 TO DVD LCD HDTV2.Cables To Go 98035 Premium HDMI v1.3 Digital Audio/Video Cable (8 Feet, Black/Grey)3.Mediabridge - 6ft Ultra-High Speed HDMI Cable - 120 Hz - Version 1.3 Category 2 - 1080p - PS3 - Blu-Ray4.Monster M Series M1000 HDTV HDMI Cable (8 ft. / 2.43 m.)5.Sony 5mm High speed HDMI cable ver. 1.3 (White)Inputs:1.PlayStation 3 80GB2. Optimum HD Cable Box/DVR (not sure of the model number)**The Test**To conduct the test I had my wife label each of the cables with a number, the cables were mixed then piled together behind the television.  With my wife assigned as the operator.  I and two friends sat on the other side of the television.  We watched pieces of Planet Earth on Blu-Ray, as well as Transformers on Blu-Ray and Standard Def.  In addition, we watched the same song from American Idol in both HD and SD, and portions of an NBA playoff game.Each of us had a card numbered 1-5 with space for comments on image quality, sound, etc.,  for each cable.  The test was, as aforementioned, blind.  This was to ensure that one of my friends (one of whom provided the $200 monster cable) and I, owner of the .01 + shipping no name cable (and most of the other ones) would not be biased by knowing it was our cable.  If you shell out $200 for something you really want it to outperform, which creates bias.And now:**The Results**All three of us agreed that there were no conclusive differences in the test.  After a lot of switching between various inputs the conclusion was that while we occasionally perceived slight differences it was never clear and would be impossible to tell if the two pictures were not side by side.Thus I must conclude that these 5 HDMI cables are, for all practical purposes, identical.  Which means that they all had average performance and the main purchase determiners are price, aesthetic quality and build quality.So to sum up, taking into account my opinion of the different cables, the HDMI Cable 6ft 6 ft 1.3 1080P FOR PS3 TO DVD LCD HDTV is the cheapest and feels it, it will probably need to be replaced soonest as well but at .01 cent plus shipping you can afford to.  The Cables To Go 98035 Premium HDMI v1.3 Digital Audio/Video Cable (8 Feet, Black/Grey) and Mediabridge - 6ft Ultra-High Speed HDMI Cable - 120 Hz - Version 1.3 Category 2 - 1080p - PS3 - Blu-Ray were pretty similar but I like the design and build quality of the Cable-to-Go a little more, it feels more solid, I feel like this one would last a while longer than the first cable but I didn't do any endurance tests.  My least favorite of the bunch in terms of feel/price was the Sony 5mm High speed HDMI cable ver. 1.3 (White) which I felt, was very thin and cheap feeling considering its price tag, I wouldn't bet that it would outlast either the Cable-to-Go cable or the Mediabridge.  The Monster M Series M1000 HDTV HDMI Cable (8 ft. / 2.43 m.) is well made and aesthetically pleasing and looks as if it will last you until something replaces HDMI, I cannot however recommend it because the price tag is simply preposterous, as it provides no visual or auditory improvement.\n",

We watched pieces of Planet Earth on Blu-Ray, as well as Transformers on Blu-Ray and Standard Def. <span style=\"background-color: #FFFF00\">In addition, we watched the same song from American Idol in both HD and SD, and portions of an NBA playoff game.Each of us had a card numbered 1-5 with space for comments on image quality, sound, etc.,  for each cable.</span> The test was, as aforementioned, blind. <span style=\"background-color: #FFFF00\">This was to ensure that one of my friends (one of whom provided the $200 monster cable) and I, owner of the .01 + shipping no name cable (and most of the other ones) would not be biased by knowing it was our cable.</span> If you shell out $200 for something you really want it to outperform, which creates bias.And now:**The Results**All three of us agreed that there were no conclusive differences in the test. <span style=\"background-color: #FFFF00\">After a lot of switching between various inputs the conclusion was that while we occasionally perceived slight differences it was never clear and would be impossible to tell if the two pictures were not side by side.Thus I must conclude that these 5 HDMI cables are, for all practical purposes, identical.</span> <span style=\"background-color: #FFFF00\">Which means that they all had average performance and the main purchase determiners are price, aesthetic quality and build quality.So to sum up, taking into account my opinion of the different cables, the HDMI Cable 6ft 6 ft 1.3 1080P FOR PS3 TO DVD LCD HDTV is the cheapest and feels it, it will probably need to be replaced soonest as well but at .01 cent plus shipping you can afford to.</span> <span style=\"background-color: #FFFF00\">The Cables To Go 98035 Premium HDMI v1.3 Digital Audio/Video Cable (8 Feet, Black/Grey) and Mediabridge - 6ft Ultra-High Speed HDMI Cable - 120 Hz - Version 1.3 Category 2 - 1080p - PS3 - Blu-Ray were pretty similar but I like the design and build quality of the Cable-to-Go a little more, it feels more solid, I feel like this one would last a while longer than the first cable but I didn't do any endurance tests.</span> <span style=\"background-color: #FFFF00\">My least favorite of the bunch in terms of feel/price was the Sony 5mm High speed HDMI cable ver.</span> <span style=\"background-color: #FFFF00\">1.3 (White) which I felt, was very thin and cheap feeling considering its price tag, I wouldn't bet that it would outlast either the Cable-to-Go cable or the Mediabridge.</span> <span style=\"background-color: #FFFF00\">The Monster M Series M1000 HDTV HDMI Cable (8 ft. / 2.43 m.) is well made and aesthetically pleasing and looks as if it will last you until something replaces HDMI, I cannot however recommend it because the price tag is simply preposterous, as it provides no visual or auditory improvement.</span>\n",

      "I've bought dozens of HDMI cables since I dove into HD a number of years ago. Recently I bought a Full-HD 3D setup and was told I had to have a special cable for it. The dealer sold me a 3' cable for $90! (And, that was one of the CHEAPER ones they had!) Now, it is true you need a \"High Speed\" rated cable for 3D (especially \"FULL-HD 3D\" @1080p), but you DON'T need to spend a lot of money on one. I felt really stupid, especially since I started having odd communications issues between my BD player and TV, all of which pointed to the $90 cable. After realizing I was a fool- I thought I would try these Mediabridge cables. I actually bought 3 of the 15' ones so I could relocate all of my equipment a bit further from the HDTV.I tested all three Mediabridge cables at Full-HD 3D (1080P). No communications errors, no artifacts or other glitches- just a consistently beautiful picture! The cables came in small cardboard boxes with minimal packaging (nice for the environment), along with a nice FAQ and warranty card. They appear to be very well constructed, and are much thicker, and more solid feeling, than the expensive (and glitch-y) cable my dealer sold me. I definitely plan to make Mediabridge my preferred HDMI cable manufacturer, and will recommend them to everyone I know.Update: 2013:Since my initial review, I have bought over a dozen of these Mediabridge cables for personal and professional use. I've used the 6', 10', 15' and 25' lengths, and have NEVER had a quality issue with them. I still consider them to be the best value in HDMI cables, with quality on-par with cables costing 10x as much, and recommend them to everyone.\n",

      "I'm a PC nerd and now entered the amazing world of Home Theater Systems. I ALWAYS purchase mid to high end hardware, and refuse to use any low end cabling on any of my systems or gadgets! My PC's and hardware are an investment that I demand quality performance from. I have used RCA, Monster, Radio Shack, and Cables-To-Go in the past. When I became an Amazon shopper (Prime Member), I found the Mediabridge cable line. I first purchased only a couple of Mediabridge cables to test as a possible replacement of my existing cables. When I received the Mediabridge cables (RCA's & HDMI), I was initially impressed by their packaging/boxing. To save money & pass the savings on to you, they poly-bag and seal their cables, and then place in a Mediabridge labeled corrugated box to the size of the cable. It did not bother me that their cables were not in a retail type blister pack to make them appear like \"quality\" out of the box etc.My first test with their cable(s) was quite impressive! Mediabridge sells ULTRA PREMIUM cables at an affordable price!! My tests went so well, that I have changed ALL OF MY CABLES TO MEDIABRIDGE (if they offer my cable in their line on Amazon)!!! Their HDMI cables are heavy weight with gold plated plugs, and they carry an audio and video signal better than any other cable I have ever used. Their Toslink Optical cables are heavy yet flexible and also carry any audio signal like no other cable I've experienced. Don't hesitate to spend a few extra dollars on their RCA cables! Their RCA line is also a quality/premium product.In closing I must say again that Mediabridge cables are PREMIUM CABLES at a reasonable price. I just invested LOTS OF $$$ in to a Home Theater System for my bedroom (EVERYTHING PURCHASED THROUGH AMAZON), and I'm not going to skimp on the cables that I need. Mediabridge is the way to go! I have already purchased NUMEROUS Mediabridge cables for my systems, and I'm not done yet-I WILL ALWAYS SEARCH THE MEDIABRIDGE LINE BEFORE I BUY A DIFFERENT BRAND CABLE. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Mediabridge as your cabling source!Happy Cabling!\n",

      "I have purchased a number of Mediabridge HDMI cables of different configurations and lengths and used them in the most demanding configurations, 1080P w/surround, etc.  Each has performed flawlessly.  As an electrical engineer I can tell you that there is WAAAYYY too much hype about HDMI cables having to be really high end and expensive.  The simple fact is that if they are built well and their performance is perfect, there is nothing more that will benefit you.  As an example, Monster Cable makes HDMI cables costing as much as $100 and they do NOTHING more or better than these cables, so why pay 10 times as much?  You are paying for marketing and name only, not performance.  Even at the price of around $10 a cable, you can afford to have one or two out of a dozen be sub-par, though I have not had one that didn't perform perfectly out of about 10 - 12 HDMI Mediabridge cables I have purchased.\n",

      "I did a comparison test.  Here are the results...COMPARISONS BETWEEN INFIGEAR AND MEDIABRIDGE AND FREEPORT OPPO HDMI CABLESI tested the InfiGear HDMI Cable against the Mediabridge, and the Freeport cable that came with my OPPO Blu-Ray Player.RESULTSThe Freeport cable that came with the OPPO Blu-Ray Player is a tad thicker than the Mediabridge and the InfiGear cables. And only the Freeport has those Ferrite Bead cylinders near the ends that reduce EM and RF interference.It was no surprise then that the OPPO Freeport cable was a bit better than the InfiGear, but only by about 1%. The picture through the OPPO cable had 1% more detail and 1% more color.The picture through the InfiGear was identical to the picture through the Mediabridge however.HOW I TESTEDBoth my receiver and my OPPO Blu-Ray player have two HDMI outputs, and my LG HDTV has two HDMI inputs, so I was able to simply use the remote to switch back and forth from one Input to the other.THE DISCS I USED FOR TESTINGI decided to use a DVD that has a bad picture when played on my old but good Sony Carousel DVD Player, and a Blu-Ray with a great picture on my new OPPO Blu-Ray player.For the bad picture, I paused a scene from season 3 of Lost In Space where Will and his mom are standing in the doorway of the Jupiter 2 talking. The scene had humans for skin tones (the most difficult color to get right). The obvious angles of the doorway (another area of difficulty). And other things and details I am familiar with. I expected the better cable to help a little, but there was no difference in picture quality on this DVD through any of the three cables.For the good picture I paused a scene from Charlie St. Cloud where he's talking with his brother at the beginning of the movie, and Charlie is wearing a medal on a ribbon with obvious angles. So again, human faces and hair, and angles, and other things and details that test a picture well.MY EQUIPMENT55&#34; LG 55L W5600 HDTVOPPO BDP-93 3D Blu-Ray PlayerSony DVD Carousel DVP-NC80V\n",
