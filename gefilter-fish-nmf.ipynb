      "Got this to replace a Peerless Paramount wall mount when I got my new TV. Maybe it's my own fault for thinking all TV wall mounts worked like the Peerless I had. See, that one has a separate TV plate that you screw to the TV first. Then you have the second piece (the actual wall mount) that you screw to the wall. Once that's done, using the bracket mounted on the TV, you hang the TV on the wall mount and secure it with a single bolt. One person can easily put a TV on the wall.Not so much with this one. Yes, I will admit that once it's mounted, it's a more secure connection, but it's the mounting that's the problem. Depending on the weight of the TV, you will need at least one helper. This mount is one piece, which means that you have to hold the TV to the wall-mounted plate while attaching it with screws. That can get tricky, especially with heavier TVs (I used it for a while with my old LCD TV which weighs 40+ pounds).\n",

      "I purchased this mount for my 37 inch LCD TV. The trouble I encountered was due to a bad wall stud finder. Make sure you have one when you install this mount because you need to screw the mount into a wall stud or at least have one screw into a wall stud.The arm of the mount sags after I hooked up my 37in. LCD TV to the mount. My TV is within the weight limit of this mount (less than 55lbs.) but the arm still sags due to the weight of the TV. I guess as long as it supports my TV, the sagging shouldn't be an issue. I do retract the arm inward towards the wall to minimize the sagging and it also gives me the warm fuzzy feeling that the arm will be less likely to break off.Overall, for the price this mount is a great deal and works but I would suggest purchasing it for flat screen TVs less than 37 inches. I would not hesitate to buy this mount again but for a 32 inch TV at most.\n",

      "Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount! !Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful.\n",

I did have a problem hanging the TV, per the instructions you have to mount the unit and now attach the TV, this was not very easy so I removed the mounting plate at the pivor point and took it off the wall mount, mounted this on the TV and now re-attached to the TV mount, this was a lot easier.\n",

      "Perhaps I misunderstood how to install the mount, but I:1) Installed the mount to the wall (easy enough)2) Attach TV the mount with some screws (difficult for one person)With one arm I held the TV (heavy!). The other arm was trying to attach some small screws connecting the TV to the mount. It took quite an effort to hold the TV for that long. Certainly having two people installing this would be waaaay easier :-)I have another similar mount where the TV back plate and the mount are separate parts.\n",

      "I gave this mount 3 stars.5 to start because out of the box, and mounted on the wall, I really liked it for my daughter's room. The ability to move her 26\" TV around so she can play in other areas of the room is a welcomed addition.I subtracted 1 star because of the tacky instructions and poor cable management for something that moves at maximum, about 2 feet away from the wall.1 more star fell off because now that the TV is mounted, the mount seems to sag, even though there are two huge lag bolts in a stud mounting it. That parts not the problem, the problem is where the tv mounts to the plate itself, it seems no matter how many washers you use, it just does not make full contact. Also if you move the TV to a new position the mounts seems to want to \"fall\" in that direction on its hinges. But for $50 I'd rather have a stationary mount that I never have to worry about. I would not set a tv larger than a 30\" or so on this.\n",

      "Very well made, strong mount the only problem I have is the instructions are very poorly written or detailed. Pictures do not distinguish between Stud mount and concrete. Also the instructions do not tell you the size of the included boltsFor those of you who have never worked in the home building industry wall studs are usually 1.5 inches wide so this mount only requires 2 lag bolts in the middle holes to secure it to the wall to support a 23 lb TV. The four outboard holes on the wall mount are 1.3\" apart so don't try to use them in a wall stud measuring 1.5\" wide.Helpful hint: I have help install at least 6 other wall mounts because of family or friends so I cannot say that I am an expert but my suggestion is to drill pilot holes which the instructions do not tell you to do.After comparing the instructions on this unit to others I have installed I still must say that the pictures should have a lot more detail. Some complain that the back plate was too big for the TV they used but it's fits perfect on theLG 32LK450 32-Inch 1080p 60Hz LCD HDTVI am using it on.Works perfectly for the area of the room I am using it in which allows me to rearrange the room without the need to move the TV.\n",

      "This was needed to mount a 32\" LCD that weighs 27 lbs in my bedroom. I looked at another mount by the same company but it did not articulate so I was worried I wouldn't be able to achieve the viewing angles that I needed. I can't fathom those more expensive mounts doing anything that this one does not. Why pay $100-$250 for a mount when you can get this one for $29.99 & oh, by the way have the confidence in 898 customer reviews averaging 4.5 stars at the time of this writing?2) FUNCTION - This mount is solid. It comes w/ lag bolts that everyone will use to mount to the wall stud. (mounting to a wall stud is required unless you are mounting to concrete) Then it has 9 different screw sets to mount the plate to the back of your TV. It has 2 washer sets for the mounting plate (based on if your TV has a flat or curved back). Then it has a spanner wrench for tightening the screw of the mounting plate. Then it also has 2 plastic anchors for mounting to a concrete wall. I have another 32\" that needs mounted.

      "Unfortunately, I'm returning this mount.Though I like the look of it, particularly the two part plastic piece that clips to the wall mount portion to cover the bolts, I feel that the one I ordered wasn't well made.I purchased it to mount aLG 26LE5300 26-Inch 720p 60Hz LED LCD HDTVin our kitchen.The mount arrived quickly and was well packaged. Unfortunately, the arm was welded to the wall bracket at a slight angle, meaning that regardless of how it would mount it and the LCD would never be level.Also, the powder coating near one of the bolts had come off and I could see some rust already forming.I decided to see if the mount would be the right fit for the tv before returning, figuring I would just get a replacement and hope for the best. I'm glad I did because this led me to find two other issues.The first one I blame on the manufacturers, the second I would consider a design flaw of the LG lcd.The first issue is that the screws supplied to attach the bracket to the tv are too few and two short. The screws are only 12mm long, and would barely catch in the threads of the TV if they weren't recessed at all. Most mounting threads on lcds and plasmas are partially recessed. I needed 20mm long screws to mount this to the tv, so a pretty fair difference over what was supplied. The manufacturer supplies several different thread and gauge options, but only one shallow length of each set.The second issue is that this universal mount covered the power and HDMI ports on the back of the 26le5300. Again, I think this is more of an issue with the tv then the mount, as they're situated rather high and central. Either way, it's something you'll want to check on your tv before ordering this product.I actually returned this and in its stead purchased a similar mount from the same company. TheVideoSecu Swing LCD Wall Mount 20 inch Extension 55 lb loading capacity for LCD TV Monitor Flat Screen VESA 75mm/100 mm 1USgets very high marks from me. This second arm did not have any of the manufacturing errors of the previous model and fit the back of my tv perfectly.I understand that it's a very affordable mount, and that most of my issues may have been resolved with a replacement. However, I just can't give this mount any higher rating than I have.\n",
